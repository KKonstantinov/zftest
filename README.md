ZFTest
------

This is the demo application used in my presentations regarding "[Quality Assurance
for PHP projects](https://speakerdeck.com/dragonbe/improving-qa-on-php-projects-zendcon-2012)" and "[Unit Testing Zend Framework Applications](https://speakerdeck.com/dragonbe/unit-testing-zend-framework-apps-phpcon-poland)".

This project should serve as a basis to try and explore unit testing, and improving quality assurance on your own projects.

If you would like to know more about unit testing, I can highly recommend the following books, both written by Chris Hartjes who's better known as [@grmpyprogrammer](https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer):

* [The Grumpy Programmer's Guide To Building Testable PHP Applications](https://leanpub.com/grumpy-testing)
* [The Grumpy Programmer's PHPUnit Cookbook](https://leanpub.com/grumpy-phpunit)

These unit tests also make use of [joindin](http://joind.in), a community driven project that provides a feedback mechanism for conference speakers and organisers.
